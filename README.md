# Surf's Up Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to use SQLite and SQLAlchemy with Python to find weather trends in Oahu. This information is needed for an investor W. Avy, who is looking to invest in a shop that sell surfboards and ice cream. W. Avy is nervous about the weather in Oahu and has a SQLite database with information about the weather. In this analysis, the data is retrieved from the database and put into a query. W. Avy specifically asks for detailed information about the temperatures in June and December. 


## Results

* The average temperature in June is 74.94 degrees.
* The average temperature in December is 71.04 degrees.
* There are more datapoints for June than there are for December. 

## Summary

This analysis proves that opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu could be a great investment for W. Avy. The average temperature throughout the year only ranges approximately 4 degrees. The standard deviation is smaller in June, so the total temperatures are closer together than they are in December. Additionally, the maximum temperatures are only 2 degrees apart between June and December. 

In order to gather more data, it could be beneficial to run queries to find the statistical information about precipitation for both June and December.
